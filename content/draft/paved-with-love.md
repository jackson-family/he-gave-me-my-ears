I&#x02bc;ve been writing about my road back to hearing, and I keep thinking about how apt a metaphor that really is.
When I started on this road, I didn&#x02bc;t know where it would end. I still don&#x02bc;t. But what I do know is that
there are plenty of people out there who are making it easier for me to walk this road.

William walks with me every day, holding my hand, and listening. He doesn&#x02bc;t try to make me walk faster than I
can, and if I sit down and cry, he waits until we&#x02bc;re ready to walk together again.

It&#x02bc;s lined with people cheering me along the way. I&#x02bc;ve been mostly plodding along, or perhaps limping and
even crawling, depending on the day, but there are people cheering me on. Sometimes someone will stop and lift me up and
help me walk a little further. And I am surprised at how many people have come out to watch me walk in the first place.

It&#x02bc;s being paved with acts of service, one brick at a time. Several bricks were set by the friends who brought us
meals during my recovery. Several bricks are being laid by my friend who is helping to teach my Primary class over
several Sundays. Bricks are laid by friends who babysit during my doctor&#x02bc;s appointments. My parents deserve to
have a whole section of my road named in their honor for all of their support, in countless ways. Amy sends me emails
written late at night to check on me. More bricks in the road. My three-year old even puts in bricks when she remembers
not to yell or slam doors because it hurts Mommy&#x02bc;s ears.

Let&#x02bc;s talk about prayer bricks. Countless bricks are being laid one at a time by all the prayers that continue to
be offered on my behalf. What I didn&#x02bc;t know until fairly recently is that my parents have prayed every day, for
the last 32 years, for my hearing. I imagine thousands of bricks being laid by those prayers alone.

It&#x02bc;s a slow road to hearing, but the road is so much easier to travel because of service and loving words.
