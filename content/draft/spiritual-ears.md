This is an analogy that has been rolling around in my head for a while, and I think that I need to write it down and
kind of develop it.

One of the most reassuring beliefs of Mormonism is that we can be counseled, guided, warned, and reassured through the
gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift is conferred after baptism, and the recipient has the wonderful opportunity and
challenge of learning to recognize and hear the Holy Ghost&#x02bc;s still small voice.

I was born with a very limited capacity to hear. Through the technology available at the time, my hearing was somewhat
improved through the use of hearing aids. I did the best I could at learning how to use the hearing aids and derive the
most benefit from them. I also had to accept the limitations of my hearing aids, despite my frustration and perhaps
naive hope that there would be something better in store someday. And then one day, I decided to get a cochlear implant.
In essence, I got a new ear. As has been fairly well documented in this here blog, learning to hear with my new ear
hasn&#x02bc;t been terribly easy. There have been successes and spectacular crashes. Sometimes I&#x02bc;m motivated to
work hard at listening, and other times, I feel like the effort is just not worth it. But I still have this new ear, and
the choice is mine whether I want to keep working and praying that it will turn out well for me in the end.

The analogy is thus.
