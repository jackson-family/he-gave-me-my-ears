Yesterday, I had a conversation that I&#x02bc;ve been thinking about since. I ran into an old friend at a church
meeting. She&#x02bc;s been following my story and asked how I&#x02bc;ve been doing. I gave her what was probably kind of
a boring answer. And then she said, &ldquo;So, is it bizarre to hear new sounds?&rdquo; It&#x02bc;s a natural question,
with the underlying assumption being that new sounds picked up by my implant must be unfamiliar and out of the limited
context of my hearing-aided world.

The response that I gave her was that no, nothing is bizarre or even unfamiliar. &ldquo;It was always there. The sounds
were always there. Nothing is unfamiliar.&rdquo; And then I choked up a little bit thinking about the significance of
that. She was very kind, but I was surprised at the emotion that her question triggered.

When I hear a new sound, say the &ldquo;s&rdquo; sound in speech or the beeping of my slow cooker timer or the rustling
of leaves in a tree, it is familiar. I don&#x02bc;t mean that they are immediately recognizable, because quite often, I
have had to ask William what a sound is. But once the sound is identified, I&#x02bc;m not surprised at how it sounds. My
reaction is more like, &ldquo;Oh, yes. That&#x02bc;s what I thought the rustling of leaves should sound like. Now I know
for sure.&rdquo;

Maybe that&#x02bc;s part of the miracle: sounds that should have been foreign to me are not. In truly hearing for the
first time, there is recognition. I really feel that I am finding in me a capacity that was always there and meant to be
tapped into. My brain and ears just needed a little outside help in finding what was already there.
