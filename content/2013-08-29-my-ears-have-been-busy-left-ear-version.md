My left implant was turned on a week ago, and I&#x02bc;ve gingerly been trying to learn how to listen with my left ear.
It is slow going! Part of the trouble is that I still have trouble getting the processor to stick to my head, even with
a super strong magnet. I just have too much hair. It&#x02bc;s like I&#x02bc;m a lion or something. On the day after
Activation Day #2, I never got it to stick after 10 frustrating minutes and one messed up ponytail and decided to go
processor-less for the day. Each day is a little easier to locate the sweet spot, and this morning was hardly any
trouble at all.

The sound is still pretty quiet and muffled, which is to be expected. There have been times when the processor came
loose, and I didn&#x02bc;t realize it because the sound is almost imperceptible. I tinkered with the volume a little bit
tonight, so maybe I will hear just a little bit better tomorrow and each day after.

It&#x02bc;s a little easier for me to accept that this is a slow process because I&#x02bc;ve been through this once
before and because I&#x02bc;m not utterly dependent on my left ear like I was with my right ear. I have one ear that
works pretty well, so it only gets better from here, right? Someday, I&#x02bc;ll have two ears that work better than
ever, and the promise of someday is good enough for me.
