I&#x02bc;ve been digging through my emails to find this. My dad had more to say, and I want to make sure that he gets to
say it! In this post, he writes about some of the electronic equipment that I used in schools, beyond my hearing aids.

And a few words from me about this. I pretty much hated wearing the FM system. I had a unit that I wore clipped to my
belt, and the teacher had a separate unit, complete with a large microphone that could be clipped onto their shirt. As
far I was concerned, I might as well have been wearing a sequined eye patch that played music. I felt very, very
conspicuous wearing it and thought that it screamed &ldquo;Special Ed!&rdquo; The good news here is that my friends
thought it was awesome because between classes, they would take the teacher&#x02bc;s unit and try to talk to me, a la
walkie-talkies. Because no kid can resist a microphone, right?

My teachers were always very understanding. Before each school year started, Mom would take me to school to meet my
teacher and warn/educate her about how to use it. The teacher&#x02bc;s unit had an on/off button, and my unit had a
volume control, as well as on/off. If I had been more mature and less curious, I could have turned my unit off whenever
the teacher left the room. Just couldn&#x02bc;t resist a good eavesdrop, I suppose. Easily the most embarrassing moment
for any of my teachers would be the time that Mrs. Smith (5th grade) forgot to turn her unit off when she went to the
restroom. I turned mine off quickly after I realized what was going on, but I couldn&#x02bc;t resist telling her when
she came back to the classroom. She was mortified, especially when she realized that I had already gleefully told the
entire class what had happened.

Until I read Dad&#x02bc;s post, I hadn&#x02bc;t realized that the local Lions Club had paid for the FM system. That was
not the only time I was the beneficiary of their charity. But I am grateful. For all the mortification it caused me, the
FM system was probably one of the reasons that I did so well in school. I was able to listen to the teacher&#x02bc;s
instruction, rather than classroom chatter, and wearing it reminded the teacher to give me just a little extra
attention. I wore it from elementary school to high school, and it is miraculous that it held up as well as it did.

One of the more inventive uses for the FM system came from my 6th grade band director. He noticed that I was playing my
instrument a little flat and thought that clipping the microphone to the bell of my clarinet would help me stay in tune.
So, we tried it out, and my problem was solved. To this day, I do not know why that helped. I don&#x02bc;t remember
changing anything else about the way that I played, but somehow, hearing my sound through the FM system kept me in tune.
He was so impressed that he even had me demonstrate to the entire band how my sound had changed.

Now, closed captioning. It is amazing! Why don&#x02bc;t more people use it? At one of my appointments with Amy, I asked
about whether I would be able to watch TV without closed captioning. She thought that with some practice, I would get
there. To me, watching TV without closed captioning is the ultimate proof that my implant has worked. (I&#x02bc;m not
there yet.) Anyway, William listened to this little interchange, and after he&#x02bc;d had enough, he piped up,
&ldquo;Uh, I don&#x02bc;t think that I want to get rid of closed captioning &hellip;&rdquo; And then we all laughed,
because closed captioning is so helpful! (Have any of you ever tried to watch something dialogue-intense like _Sherlock_
or _The Social Network_ without captioning? How did you keep up with it?)

Just over a year ago, the movie theater closest to us started using [in-seat captioning devices][a]. I&#x02bc;ve used
this device twice, with _The Help_ and _The Hunger Games_, and boy, has it revolutionized my movie-watching experience.
The first time I used the device, I couldn&#x02bc;t help but think just how far accessibility for hearing-impaired
people has come. I was, and continue to be, grateful to live in a time when such help is available.
