Last weekend, William was outside mowing the yard, while the girls and I played inside. In the middle of his work, he
came inside and asked me to join him outside. &ldquo;There&#x02bc;s something I want to show you.&rdquo; He pointed at a
tree in our backyard. &ldquo;There&#x02bc;s a cicada in that tree. I want you to hear it.&rdquo; So we waited for a few
seconds. Then the cicada started chirping, and William said, &ldquo;That&#x02bc;s a cicada! Do you hear it?&rdquo; And I
did! It was loud and clear and very chirpy, and I wondered how I&#x02bc;d never been able to hear cicadas chirping in
all of my years.

Now I hear them everywhere. And each time I hear a cicada, it reminds me of William taking the time to help me hear
something magical.
