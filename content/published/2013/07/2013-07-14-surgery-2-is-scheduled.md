On Wednesday, August 14, one month from today, I&#x02bc;m scheduled to have my left ear implanted. It&#x02bc;s exciting
and nerve-wracking. I&#x02bc;m excited because my implanted right ear continues to improve and nervous because the
recovery after my first surgery was so rough.

Later on this fall, I should be able to upgrade to a better processor, the [Nucleus 6][a]. Among other things, it should
have improved sound processing and wireless connectivity to accessories like microphones and, I hope, cell phones. Once
again, I consider myself so lucky that the technology continues to improve at a rapid rate and that I&#x02bc;m in a
position to take advantage of it all.
