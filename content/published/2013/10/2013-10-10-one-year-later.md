My one-year cochlear implant anniversary sneaked up on me. But it&#x02bc;s today. One year ago today, my right ear was
implanted, and my world changed forever.

It&#x02bc;s easy for me now to take for granted that my hearing is better, because hasn&#x02bc;t it always been like
this? No, it certainly hasn&#x02bc;t, as anyone who has known me for a long time can tell you. But my ears and my brain
are working so well together now that I&#x02bc;m forgetting that they used to be largely at odds (and my ears always
won, leaving my brain to wonder what in the world to do with those dinky little signals that it was getting once in a
while). I&#x02bc;m grateful that I&#x02bc;ve been given a second chance, so to speak.

A few weeks ago, I heard Molly singing &ldquo;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&rdquo; in our living room, while I was
working on dinner in the kitchen. I commented to William that she had been singing that song over and over all day long,
and he said, &ldquo;I&#x02bc;m impressed that you can even hear her singing at all.&rdquo; It&#x02bc;s moments like
those that make me pause to reflect for just a moment about the miracle that&#x02bc;s been wrought.

It only gets better from here. Can&#x02bc;t wait!
