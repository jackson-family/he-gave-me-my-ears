Of late, my prayers are mostly filled with gratitude and thanks. It&#x02bc;s a funny thing that amidst some challenges
and difficulties, I would be most mindful of things to be thankful for. The thing I ask for most is &ldquo;Please help
me to hear.&rdquo; But the thanks go on and on.

I feel especially keenly this year that we are such a blessed family, to have our health, a roof over our heads, clothes
to wear, food to eat, and a steady source of income. We are surrounded by family and friends who care deeply and serve
quietly but meaningfully. We have access to good medical care and technology. Our lives are richer for having the gospel
of Jesus Christ to teach us how to find happiness in the things that matter most.

For all these things, I&#x02bc;m giving thanks.
