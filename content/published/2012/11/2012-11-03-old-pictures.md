While I&#x02bc;m away for the weekend, I didn&#x02bc;t want to leave this blog unattended. My mom found some pictures of
me wearing [my first hearing aids][a]. Here&#x02bc;s one, from my brother&#x02bc;s 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday party.
I&#x02bc;m wearing the blue halter that my mom sewed to hold my hearing aids. She made four to match my different
outfits: blue, red, white, and yellow. Very fashionable!

By 1984, I must have gotten new, less conspicuous hearing aids, since the halters are missing in this picture.
