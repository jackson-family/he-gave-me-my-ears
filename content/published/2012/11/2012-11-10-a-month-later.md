One month ago today, my cochlear implant was put into my right ear. Has it really been a month already? In some ways it
feels like a lifetime ago, and in some ways, it feels like just yesterday. We didn&#x02bc;t do much to recognize this
milestone, but perhaps we should have.

I&#x02bc;m feeling almost 100% better (except for a teeny bit of dizziness if I sit up too quickly). My incision is
healed, so I was able to get a long-overdue haircut this afternoon.

And tonight, I realized that for the first time in my life, I can clearly hear the &ldquo;s&rdquo; sound in words. It
was so unexpected that I didn&#x02bc;t recognize what was happening until I slowed down and truly listened. This must be
the beginning of the miracle, evident only in recognizing the smallest changes in what I&#x02bc;m hearing but evident
all the same. I expect to have more of those minor miracles in the coming days and weeks until I will look back over my
progress and realize that the complete and majestic miracle has unfolded slowly but surely.
