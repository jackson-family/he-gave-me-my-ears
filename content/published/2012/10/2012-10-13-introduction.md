I have a story to tell. It&#x02bc;s a story about me and my disability. Well,
some people might call it a disability, and I probably did when I was younger.
But now, I think of it more as a challenge to keep me humble in the midst of
many other blessings and talents. I was born with severe to profound hearing
loss in my right ear and a profound loss in my left ear. I&#x02bc;ve worn
hearing aids my whole life. Big, powerful, conspicuous hearing aids that somehow
manage to wring out every last bit of hearing that I had. In April 2011, I
bought new hearing aids for the last time. On October 10, 2012, a surgeon put a
cochlear implant into my right ear, and if all goes well, I will have another
implant put into my left ear sometime in 2013.

There&#x02bc;s a Primary children&#x02bc;s song called &ldquo;I Know Heavenly
Father Loves Me.&rdquo; The second verse has had special meaning for me.

> *He gave me my eyes that I might see the color of butterfly wings.*  
> *He gave me my ears that I might hear the magical sound of things.*  
> *He gave me my life, my mind, my heart. I thank Him reverently*  
> *For all his creations of which I&#x02bc;m a part.*  
> *Yes, I know Heavenly Father loves me.*

I decided that would be an appropriate title for this blog because I look
forward to hearing the magical sounds of so many more things than I ever have
before.

Like I said, I have a story to tell. I don&#x02bc;t know how this story will
end, or when. But I want to tell it as it unfolds. The date on this post is
October 13, 2012, which means that chronologically, I&#x02bc;m in the middle of
my story. The blog posts may be somewhat chronological, or I may exercise
artistic license and throw in some background material for some of my posts. But
the story will largely focus on my road back to hearing. Sometimes I&#x02bc;ll
have William weigh in with his side of the story, because this part of the story
is almost as much his as it is mine.

My hope is that as others read my story, they will come away with a greater
appreciation for the tremendous God-given capacity that our bodies have. I hope
that they&#x02bc;ll understand that living with a disability is challenging,
just as living in a body that works pretty well can be challenging, too. I hope
that they&#x02bc;ll recognize that the road to my recovery continues to be built
on a foundation of prayers, fasts, kind words of encouragement, and generous
acts of service. And above all, I hope that they&#x02bc;ll understand a little
more about the Master Healer of us all.
