We all know Rebecca is pretty good at lip-reading. So when we watched _The
Artist_ together she usually knew what the characters had said before the
intertitles flashed onto the screen. I think this is amazing because I
can&#x02bc;t do it.

Anyway, we watched _The Artist_ together. Before we started I wasn&#x02bc;t
sure I would like it. I don&#x02bc;t remember much from the &#x02bc;20s, after
all. I was raised on talkies. But I watched it anyway, and I liked it.

While we were watching, I didn&#x02bc;t really understand why the protagonist,
George Valentin, was such a downer over talking pictures. Why did his anxiety
give him nightmares? I just didn&#x02bc;t get it.

Then came the very last scene and George spoke his only audible line in the
whole movie, and the punch line hit me like a ton of bricks. He had a thick
French accent! This blew me away.

First, you should understand that I really don&#x02bc;t pay much attention to
which actors are in a film. If I considered that sort of thing, I would have
known beforehand that the actor&#x02bc;s name was _Jean Dujardin_, and you
can&#x02bc;t get more Frencher than that.

The point I am trying to make here is that I had invented a voice in my head to
fill in the gap left by the silent film. I somehow fabricated what I expected
George Valentin to sound like, and to me, he sounded authentically American.
This was Hollywood, after all.
