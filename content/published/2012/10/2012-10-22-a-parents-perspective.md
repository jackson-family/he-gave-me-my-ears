title: A Parent&#x02bc;s Perspective

Time to give you a break from me. My story began 32 years ago. Here&#x02bc;s how
my dad tells it. I&#x02bc;m breaking it into several posts, but here&#x02bc;s
the beginning of the story. I thought it would be especially appropriate, as I
approach Activation Day on Wednesday, to start with the first time that I heard
a sound. I wonder if my reaction will be similar.

> First, a bit of background. Rebecca&#x02bc;s hearing loss was not formally
> diagnosed until she was about 13 months old. We had noticed that she did not
> always respond as expected as an infant. For example, I remember standing in
> her bedroom doorway and talking to her without her apparent notice until I
> walked up to the crib so that I was in her field of vision. (If she had been a
> teenager, I would have thought that this was completely normal.) Then she
> would kick her legs and almost quake in excitement. (That would certainly have
> been abnormal for a teenager.)

> One night I thought that I would &ldquo;test&rdquo; her hearing by clapping
> while she was sitting on the floor with her back to me. She immediately
> jumped, so I concluded that she could hear just fine, but was just an
> unusually serene child. Later, after her hearing loss had been confirmed, it
> occurred to me that she had not &ldquo;heard&rdquo; the clap as much as she
> &ldquo;felt&rdquo; the concussion of it.

> Her pediatrician had not seemed particularly alarmed by our concerns about her
> hearing. I think that he dismissed our anecdotal evidence as typical of new
> parents of a first child. (Incidentally, this is why I often refer to Rebecca
> as &ldquo;my firstborn in the wilderness of my affliction&rdquo;: we lived in
> Corpus Christi when she was born. Anyone who has lived there would
> understand.) 

> Anyway, we moved to New Braunfels and got a new pediatrician. Testing
> infants&#x02bc; hearing must have been a new technology in those days, not a
> routine procedure as it is today. It must have been the new pediatrician, Dr.
> Frank Hampel, who encouraged us to take her for testing, which was done at
> Texas State University (then SWTSU). We were expecting to hear that she needed
> to have tubes inserted in her ears for drainage and that they would solve the
> problem.

> I think that we handled the diagnosis of &ldquo;profound hearing loss in both
> ears&rdquo; pretty calmly. Looking back, though, I cannot understand why we
> would have been so calm. We must not have understood all the implications for
> her &mdash; and for us.

> I don&#x02bc;t know who it was that recommended that we take her to the
> Sunshine Cottage in San Antonio for evaluation and therapy, but it was a
> God-send. The faculty there recommended to us that we follow the philosophy of
> making use of whatever hearing she had, assisted by hearing aids, and teaching
> her to hear and talk without resorting to sign language. I know that this is a
> highly charged controversy among the hearing-impaired. But for Rebecca it has
> been a blessing.

> In those days technology was such that the hearing aids best suited for her
> were small rectangular boxes about the size of a package of cigarettes. She
> would need to wear them at chest level, with the aids connected to ear-pieces
> in both ears by thin wires. Her mother was supposed to sew several elastic
> &ldquo;halters&rdquo; with tight loops in them to hold the hearing aids
> securely. Yes, this made them very conspicuous, and we worried that she might
> reject them as being &ldquo;unfashionable&rdquo; even at that tender age. I
> told my wife, &ldquo;We&#x02bc;ll just tell her that it is a training bra and
> she won&#x02bc;t mind at all.&rdquo; We have very few pictures of Rebecca
> wearing the halters, but she was as cute as a bug in them.

> I well remember the day that her hearing aids were installed for the first
> time. The therapist, Dan, at Sunshine Cottage had &ldquo;warned&rdquo; us that
> the experience could be traumatic for her, since it would be the first time
> for her to ever hear any sound. He was very gentle. Rebecca sat in my lap
> while he inserted the hearing aids into the halters, and then inserted the ear
> pieces into her ears. He was sensitive to any reaction on her part that would
> indicate that she was uncomfortable or upset at any stage. Then he turned on
> one of the aids. We waited in eager anticipation to see what miracle was about
> to unfold before our very eyes.

> She promptly fell asleep in my arms.

More to come from my dad soon. And just to give you an idea about the difficult
decisions that parents make for a deaf child, here&#x02bc;s a great
[blog post][a] from the New York Times that ran last year.
