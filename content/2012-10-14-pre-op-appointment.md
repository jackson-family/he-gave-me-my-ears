On Monday, October 8, I had my pre-op appointment with my doctor, Dr. Slater.
When I checked in, the receptionist handed me a four-page document to look over
and sign. The first two pages listed all the things that could possibly go wrong
with surgery, the third page described how I should take care of myself after
surgery, and the last page was a consent form to indicate that yes, I understood
the risks of surgery. I also had to fill in the blank on the signature page:
&ldquo;I want Dr. Slater to operate on my _____ ear.&rdquo; This would be the
first of many times that I had to confirm that my right ear was to be implanted.

Here are the things that were listed on the first two pages of the document:

* Hearing loss: Since the hearing in my right ear is comparatively better than
  my left ear, so putting an implant in my right ear was fairly risky. In the
  unlikely event that something went wrong, I would be worse off than I was
  before the implant.
* Dizziness: The implant goes through the vestibular system and causes a pretty
  big disruption. For the first time in my life, I would have vertigo.
* Taste Disturbances: The surgery can damage the nerve that supplies taste.
* Ringing: Tinnitus is pretty common and understandably so. I&#x02bc;d never had
  a problem with it before.
* Facial Nerve Paralysis: Same idea as taste disturbances. Some of the nerves
  controlling the face could be pushed aside since they run through the middle
  ear.
* Perforation of the ear drum: Ouch.
* Infection and Meningitis: Scary, but good thing I got a meningitis vaccine
  last week.
* Cerebral Spinal Fluid Leak: My cochleas have a Mondini malformation, meaning
  that the bones do not have the full number of turns. Cochleas look like
  snails, at least normal ones do, and they have at least 2 full turns. Mine
  have 1-1/4 turns. This would put me at a higher risk of spinal fluid leak,
  hence the need for the meningitis vaccine.

Post-surgery things to remember:

* No hair-washing for 3-5 days after surgery
* Resume a normal diet on the day after surgery
* Do not blow your nose for one week (this seemed to be maybe the most unhelpful
  thing ever. We are in the middle of fall allergy season here in Austin!)
* Do not bend over after surgery.
* No physical activity for one week, regardless of how you&#x02bc;re feeling,
  and no lifting more than 20 pounds (sorry, Emily and Molly.)
* Do not exercise or play sports for three weeks after surgery
* Do not swim or fly until the doctor says it&#x02bc;s OK

I read through all of these worst-case scenarios and instructions then signed
the consent form. No need to fear. Of all the emotions associated with impending
surgery, fear was never one of them. However, I wasn&#x02bc;t sure whether this
would be something to show my mother. Ha.

The appointment itself started out with Dr. Slater&#x02bc;s PA, who asked me if
I&#x02bc;d signed the consent form (I had) and handed me a prescription for
Zofran and Norco. I had to ask what they were for. (Nausea and pain.) He also
told me that the hospital would call with instructions for surgery. Because the
surgery would be at a hospital in a part of town that I don&#x02bc;t know, I
asked if they had maps to the hospital; they didn&#x02bc;t. I guess
that&#x02bc;s what Google Maps is for.

Dr. Slater came in next and looked at my ears with his otoscope. I&#x02bc;m not
sure what he was looking for since everything affected by a cochlear implant is
hiding behind the ear drum. I teased him about the scary side effects hand out
and told him to &ldquo;Please be careful.&rdquo; He smiled sheepishly and said,
&ldquo;I&#x02bc;ve never hurt anyone yet.&rdquo; And that was about it. Cleared
for a cochlear implant on Wednesday.
