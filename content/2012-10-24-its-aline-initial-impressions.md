We just got home from my implant activation. I will write more later, but here
are initial impressions. Everything sounds like a bell with a ton of
reverberation. My grandma had a Wurlitzer organ that we played with all the
time, and it had different buttons to change the reverb. Being the really
annoying kids that we were, we always turned the reverb level as high as we
could. That&#x02bc;s what I&#x02bc;m hearing right now.

Voices sound like low-toned bells. I could hear the audiologist&#x02bc;s voice,
but soft-spoken William is still hard to hear. Every other noise that I hear
sounds like a bell: footsteps, typing on my keyboard, William turning the key in
the ignition, the garage door. Here&#x02bc;s another way to think of it: a
microphone that&#x02bc;s turned up too high. Just before the feedback starts,
the speaker&#x02bc;s voice sounds whiny and words are not necessarily
intelligible.

The volume is turned way down on my processor, so I will start listening at a
level that&#x02bc;s comfortable and then turn it up incrementally. I can still
wear my left hearing aid, which will be very helpful while I&#x02bc;m figuring
out how this wonderful world really sounds. And that&#x02bc;s how Day One goes.
