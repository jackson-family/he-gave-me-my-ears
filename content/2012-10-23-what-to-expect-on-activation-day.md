Today I got an email from Amy, the audiologist who will be activating my implant
tomorrow at 9. Here&#x02bc;s what she said that we can expect.

> For activation tomorrow, you can bring ANYONE you&#x02bc;d like. My room is
> only big enough for about 2 other adults, and your kids would probably get
> VERY bored, so just keep that in mind. Also &mdash; I don&#x02bc;t mind at all
> if you record, video, take pictures, etc., of your visit tomorrow. It&#x02bc;s
> your appointment, so you can do whatever you&#x02bc;d like. The first 45 
>minutes will be not very eventful. I will put your processor on your head, make
> sure the magnet and headpiece stay in place, check the function of the
> internal implant, etc. Then we&#x02bc;ll spend about 20-30 minutes having you
> listen to EXTREMELY soft beeps at different pitches. This will help me set the
> very softest level for your first set of programs. Then we&#x02bc;ll turn on
> the sound, adjust it until it&#x02bc;s comfortable &hellip; all while you are
> slowly adjusting to the new sound of your implant. It will takes us another
> 45-60 minutes to review ALL of the equipment that you&#x02bc;ll be using, as
> well as appropriate auditory rehab exercises to do at home.

> Let me know if you come up with any questions before tomorrow. I really look
> forward to seeing you and turning on your implant!! It will be the beginning
> of a whole new journey!

And that&#x02bc;s it. Stay tuned for pictures and if it&#x02bc;s not too
embarrassing, a video!
