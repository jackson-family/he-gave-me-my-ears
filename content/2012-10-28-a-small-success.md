This morning in the car on the way to church, we were listening to Primary
songs. I usually can&#x02bc;t hear the CDs in the car, especially anything
with vocals. This morning, I distinctly heard &ldquo;If You're Happy and You
Know It.&rdquo; Here&#x02bc;s what I heard (with my implant and my hearing aid
both on).

> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, clap your hands.  
> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, touch your nose.  
> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, blink your eyes.  
> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, touch your ears.

And just now, we checked the lyrics in the song book. Here&#x02bc;s how it
actually goes.

> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, clap your hands. (Check!)  
> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, tap your toes. (Close!)  
> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, blink your eyes. (Check!)  
> If you&#x02bc;re happy and you know it, snap your fingers. (Well.
> There&#x02bc;s always room for improvement.)

Just wanted to put that out there. A small success!
