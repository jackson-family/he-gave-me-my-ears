William did a very nice job of writing about what happened at the appointment,
and the video cuts out a lot of the less interesting parts of the Activation Day
appointment this morning. My homework now is to practice listening to words from
one person at a time in a quiet room with only my implant on. (Today, I had my
hearing aid in my left ear for practical and safety reasons.) My mom is going to
be the first to help me with homework tonight, and if I&#x02bc;m lucky, I might
be able to understand her voice a little bit by the end of it. We&#x02bc;re
going to keep it simple. I imagine that I&#x02bc;ll get out some of
Molly&#x02bc;s baby books and go through them. &ldquo;Ball.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bath.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kitty.&rdquo; Rigorous stuff.

I love parallelism, so here&#x02bc;s some more from my dad about the first time
that I learned to hear.

Oh, a word about learning to talk. Dad points out that my hearing loss cuts out
high frequency sounds, so I&#x02bc;ve had trouble reproducing sounds I
can&#x02bc;t hear. Today at my appointment, Amy was asking about whether my
hearing had changed at all over my lifetime. She kept saying, &ldquo;The way you
talk makes me think that at some point when you were young, you were able to
hear those sounds.&rdquo; Even after my mom got there and insisted as nicely as
possible that my hearing has always been terrible, Amy didn&#x02bc;t seem
terribly convinced.

Here&#x02bc;s the deal. I had to suffer through years of frustrating, maddening
speech therapy while I was in public schools. I don&#x02bc;t remember being a
terribly cooperative patient, but little kids don&#x02bc;t often have much say
in what grown-ups make them do at school. Nor did I really understand the point
of it. And I especially hated being pulled out of class to go do special ed
stuff. When I was at BYU, upon recommendation from my dad, I had two more years
of therapy in their on-campus clinic with graduate students. Everyone loved me
because adult patients were so hard to come by. I was a much more cooperative
patient by then. And here in Austin, I had a friend who was a speech therapy
graduate student, so for about a year, I would go to her apartment once a week
for therapy sessions. It has taken me a very long time to get where I am today.
And maybe once I&#x02bc;m comfortable with the implant, I&#x02bc;ll be ready for
even more therapy.
