Sweet little Molly is talking! About two weeks ago, we were reading a baby book about food together (of course). She was
babbling and cooing as usual, but as I listened more closely, I heard her saying something over and over again.
&ldquo;Apper, epper, apper, apper, pepper, apper, apple, apple, apple.&rdquo; And then I said, &ldquo;Molly, did you
say, &lsquo;apple?&rsquo;&rdquo; And she beamed and kept on saying, &ldquo;Apple, apple, apple.&rdquo; This new ear of
mine gave me the gift of hearing my child&#x02bc;s first word clearly. (And it would seem that
[I&#x02bc;ve come a long way][a].)
